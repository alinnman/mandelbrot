# mandelbrot
 
This project is just an exercise in fractal geometry using the well-known Mandelbrot fractal. 
In order to plot the data I use the cplot Python package by Nico Schl√∂mer (https://github.com/nschloe/cplot.git). This package is also available in PyPi. 
I have made some very minor changes to this package and made a fork. You need my fork in order to visualize the data quickly since there are some optimizations (using the original cplot will take a very long time).
